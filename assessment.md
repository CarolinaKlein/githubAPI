* **What is the convention for naming classes in CSS?**  
Classes are preceded with a dot (.) in the css file. 
Assign classes to the lowest level possible in the HTML.
Choose a name that references what part of the document you are targeting.
Avoid camel case. Try "top-nav" instead of "topNav".
Besides nav, txt, url, and btn, avoid abbreviations.  

* **What is one way to stop a form from submitting with JavaScript?**  
The .preventDefault() method is used to tell the code that if the form is not explicitly
handled with an event handler, then the form should not be submitted. 

* **When should HTML code be validated?**  
After you have made changes to your HTML file, and before commiting the changes.

* **What is the DOM? Please elaborate on this question.**  

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects. That way, programming languages can connect to the page. 
It is essentially an API to the page, allowing programs to read and manipulate the pageâ€™s content, structure, and styles.

A Web page is a document. This document can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source. But it is the same document in both cases. The Document Object Model (DOM) represents that same document so it can be manipulated. The DOM is an object-oriented representation of the web page, which can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.  


* **Which one is better: CSS Grid, Flexbox or just plain CSS?**  
Grid has two dimensions (colums and rows) where as Flexbox only has one dimension (either colums or rows). Which means you can make div arrangements more complex in Grid than in Flexbox, which makes grid better. And IMO, those two are better than plain CSS because they allow for structure, and I like structure. 

* **When should one stop learning?**  
NEVER.
