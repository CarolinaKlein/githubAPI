* **What is the convention for naming classes in CSS?**  
Classes are preceded with a dot (.) in the css file. 
Assign classes to the lowest level possible in the HTML.
Choose a name that references what part of the document you are targeting.
Avoid camel case. Try "top-nav" instead of "topNav".
Besides nav, txt, url, and btn, avoid abbreviations.
